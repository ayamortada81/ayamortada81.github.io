											<h2>About Me</h2>
											
										</header>
										
										<p>Graduated from high school in 2020 and 
											I have always had a deep passion for food, art, and creativity. 
											This combination of interests led to my pursue a teaching degree,
											 where the creative elements of both food 
											and art could be intertwined with educational practices.</p>
										<br> 
										<br>
										<h1> Passion for Food </h1>
										<p>The passion for food is deeply rooted in my Lebanese culture and 
											the traditions passed down from her mother and grandmother. 
											In my family, food has always been at the heart of every occasion, 
											turning even the simplest moments into a celebration, and providing comfort
											during times of mourning.</p>
										<br> 
										<br> 
										<h1> Passion for Art</h1>
										<p> My passion for art is inspired by myfather, 
											who has always been a creative soul. In Lebanon, he would create religious artwork
											for family members, and after moving to Australia, 
											he channeled his artistic talents into the tiling business.
											 Over time, he found his niche and passion in home and bathroom renovations,
											  where his love for art continues to thrive.</p>

							<h3>Why Teaching? </h3>
							<p>Teaching is a profession that goes beyond imparting knowledge; its about inspiring, 
								nurturing, and shaping the minds of future generations. For many, including  
								the decision to pursue teaching stems from a deep-seated desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. 
								The classroom is a dynamic environment where creativity, empathy, and knowledge come together to foster growth and 
								learning. Teaching offers the opportunity to blend these elements, allowing educators to engage students in meaningful
								 ways that resonate beyond the confines of the classroom.

								For me, teaching is not just a job; its a calling that aligns with her passions for food, 
								art, and creativity. The ability to incorporate these interests into her teaching practice makes the profession 
								even more fulfilling. Whether its through integrating artistic projects into lessons or using culinary experiences
								to explain complex concepts, teaching allows my to share her passions while also contributing to the intellectual and 
								emotional development of her students. The impact a teacher can have on a student's life is profound, and this potential for
								positive change is what makes teaching a rewarding and purposeful career.</p>
